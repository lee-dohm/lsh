# `lsh` - Lee's SHell

This is my custom Unix shell. It is my intention to, over time, build a [POSIX-compatible shell](http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/contents.html) with the following features:

* Live syntax highlighting
* Simple command and parameter completion
* Sane and opinionated defaults
* Extensibility
* Built in Ruby for rapid development

This effort was inspired by:

* [fish](http://fishshell.com)
* [A Unix Shell in Ruby](http://www.jstorimer.com/blogs/workingwithcode/7766107-a-unix-shell-in-ruby)
* [pry](http://pryrepl.org)
