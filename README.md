# `lush` - The Lifted Unix Shell

This is my custom Unix shell, written in [Ruby][ruby]. It is my intention to, over time, build a [POSIX-compatible shell][posix] with the following features:

* Live syntax highlighting
* Simple command and parameter completion
* Sane and opinionated defaults
* Extensibility via plugins
* Written in Ruby for rapid development

## Rationale

I used the [`fish` shell][fish] for a while and really liked a lot of the features. The major drawback to using `fish` is that it is not 100% POSIX or Bourne shell compatible. This means that there are scripts out there for things like `rbenv` or `rvm` that don't work out of the box. So I continued to lust after a better shell. I had the inkling to write my own, but I really didn't want to delve back into C/C++ to do it.

Then I stumbled upon [a series of blog articles][shell-in-ruby] that showed how to write the very beginnings of a `bash`-like shell in Ruby. I've used this series of articles as my starting point and inspiration because I realized that these days a Unix shell doesn't need to be written in C. I really think that a fully fleshed-out Unix shell written in Ruby can enable a whole new round of innovation in the shell interface.
